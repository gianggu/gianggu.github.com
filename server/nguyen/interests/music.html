        <h1>Ooh Aahh Music</h1>
        <p>I also have a big love for music. Music has become a teaching of life for me that cannot be replicated in any other form. The artists that I began to admire when I was in high school had given me such new, <br>beautiful perspectives on the workings of life and society. At some point, I branched from my exclusive search for meaningful lyrics and allowed more fun and diverse music into my libraries. </p>

        <p>Last month, I went to a concert for Kpop group, GIDLE, and it was a levitating experience, and they were so pwetty. </p>

        <p>Concerts have always been so fun for me, and I go to many more nowadays.</p>
