        <h1>What's cookin'?</h1>

        <p>Cooking is something that is always enjoyable for me because I love to eat! And to have fun eating, I have to cook good food! This is no joke, eating is my main source of happiness. I like to come up with interesting recipes, and not to brag, but they always turn out amazing.

        <p>This is a photo of a dish I made a few months back. Although I like to eat gourmet food and live the lavish life, I’m still a college student so I’d prefer to plate all of my food in the single pan I cooked with. I think it’s revolutionary.</p>
