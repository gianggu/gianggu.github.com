        <h2>Welcome to my ~all about me~ website! </h2>

        <p>My name is Gianna Nguyen, also known as Gia. I’ve a few things to share about my life. 
            I’m a 4th year at UC Davis with a focus on UI/UX Design and Managerial Economics. I love a variety of things, but some things are just irreplaceable for me. You can find out what those are in the other links!
