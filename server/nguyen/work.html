        <h1>So you're interested in what I do?</h1>

        <p><b>I do many things!</b> Like so much, honestly. I wonder how I’m always feeling occupied, but it’s because I quite literally am. :p</p>

        <p>I am working as a digital analytics intern for a government news broadcasting company called Voice of America. This work is definitely interesting to me and it keeps me quite busy outside of school. It’s a bit far from my current UI/UC major though, so I have that to work out in the next few years. I’m really determined to self-study a variety of tech-skills and enhance my portfolio. <br>Generally, I like to make art and be creative! Here's a little doodle of my two puppers.
