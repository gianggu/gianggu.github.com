            <h3 class="titles">Overview</h3>

            <p>This report is an analysis of the Jan Shrem and Maria Manetti Shrem Museum of Art’s approach to fulfill its educational goal for its audience. I evaluated the museum on its physical attributes and their inclusion in achieving the museum’s purpose. Analyses on the delivery media’s displays, such as the lighting, layout, and text, and how they shape visitor experience will be included in this report.

             <h3 class="titles">Introduction</h3>

            <p>The purpose of this site visit is to observe the structure of the museum and its interior design in connection with the message the Shrem museum wants to convey. The museum’s website states that, “The Manetti Shrem Museum opened in 2016 with a mission to inspire new thinking and the open exchange of ideas through its exhibitions and programs, with a particular emphasis on serving students and the university community.” To achieve this, the museum uses particular lighting, layout, and text throughout the building. The exhibits have their personalized purposes which fall under its main mission.</p>

            <p>The observation questions that were used as guidelines for this report are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How does the media encourage creative thinking as the museum’s purpose stated?</li>
                <li>Does the media display placement influence a viewer’s attention?</li>                 
                <li>Does the physical environment encourage the full potential of intended interactions with the displays?
                <ul>
                    <li>How is the lighting affecting the effectiveness of the experience?</li>
                    <li>How does the signage help viewers to better understand the art?</li>
                </ul>
                </li>

            <p>Upon entering the museum, I observed the very blank, white interior design of the museum’s lobby. The building is overall very white, and so all of the furniture and artwork sticks out to the eye. For example, In Figure 1, because the walls of the lobby are vsery minimal in design, the vivid blue couch immediately attracts one’s attention. The building entrance has natural light from the sun shining inside that brings a glow to the room, which contrasts the dimmer lighting that can be observed once you enter the exhibits. The use of lighting at this site is strategically used to put a clear distinction between the exhibits and the outside world.</p>


            <p>In the Shrem museum, the ceiling lights are on a high ceiling and are angled so that they point at the specific directions where the artworks are displayed. The lights brighten up the entire room though, as well. The positioning of the lights is a subtle adjustment since the entire room is still very well lit along with the art attractions. The lighting is straightforward and minimalistic so that the artwork is able to receive all the focus. As Ball, Cheryl, E. et al. stated in Writer/Designer., “Writer/designers can leverage perspective in intentional ways through strategies like the use of angles (such as subjects viewed from above or below).” With this knowledge, we can say that the lighting directs the observer’s gaze towards the intended displays. The use of the visual mode does not draw any extra attention to itself which is important for a viewer’s attention to the art work.

            <p>The lighting and building structure go hand in hand by implementing spatial elements to create the mood of the museum’s exhibits. For instance, one of the smaller rooms had a change in lighting to where it was more dim and the lights were angled straight down, which can be seen in Figure 2. The lights have a yellow tint which typically garners a feeling of comfort. Paired with the smaller structure of the room, these display media give a more intimate feel between the artworks and the viewer. Such an experience would increase viewer attention by making the artwork feel different from the others outside of this exhibit room.

                <h3 class="subtitles"><i>Physical Space</i></h3>

            <p>The physical space of the museum was designed very intentionally. The first thing I noticed as I approached the building was the large surface area in front of it. As seen in Figure 3, the front space has a large overhead design which suggests to guests where the divide is between the museum’s design and everything outside of it.</p>

            <figure class="float-left">

            </figure>   

            <p>The museum’s art pieces are given a lot of space for a viewer to look at a single piece and see only that art piece in his or her main vision. The wide spacing between each art piece permits the viewer to not become distracted with other commotions, and solely focus on the display in front of him or her.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
                <h3 class="subtitles"><i>Signage and Text</i></h3>

            <p>Signs take a large part in the navigation of a guest’s interaction with the museum’s displays. QR codes, such as the one seen in Figure 5, are placed in numerous spots and contain information regarding its exhibits. Guests come in contact with QR codes at nearly every display. The QR codes bring the user to a website link that presents detailed information on the piece being displayed. In-depth information gives more insight to the person who is viewing the exhibit. This form of the linguistic mode provides a lot of knowledge to the observer of the history and meaning behind the piece, which permits them to have better educated thoughts after viewing each display and its QR code.</p>

            <figure class="float-left">
                <img src="images/figure_4.jpg" alt="Figure 4" width="182" height="230">
                <figcaption class="description2">

                </figcaption>
            </figure>  

            <p>Another form of signage are the small texts printed beside the art on the walls of the exhibits. These descriptions are shown in a small sized font that is simple. The neutral font does not distract the viewer from the messages they relay, however, I found the text to be unappealing to read at times. The signage is not as efficient as the other elements in supporting the museum’s mission. Some artworks are paired with descriptions that are very long, which may disinterest the guest. An example can be viewed in Figure 6 below. Though it is an affordance to be able to give access to outside links that don’t take up the museum’s space, there are constraints within this element. Such long texts in a very small font along with a QR code that leads viewers to a long article can overwhelm the viewer and deter them from reading. Requiring viewers to use a device in order to receive more information about the artwork is a constraint that does not benefit the museum. This display of the ample text is ineffective for the Shrem museum’s main goal for its visitors of educating them and stimulating new thoughts.</p>

            <h3 class="titles">CONCLUSION</h3>
            <p>Upon observing the Manetti Shrem Museum of Art’s design, I noticed many purposefully placed details that the museum used to curate a particular experience with its viewers. The simple interior structure allows small changes in design to give a significant impact to the feel of the environment. The exhibits are outlined with white walls and yellow ceiling lights which both give a plain canvas for the art to stand out from. The lighting creates most of the mood shifts in the different sections of the exhibits, making it a very effective tactic the museum uses. Throughout the museum are a number of signs that help guide the guests as they travel through the exhibit but there could be some adjustments to even better navigate the guests. These elements are very effective in fulfilling the museum’s mission statement. All of the interior design is dedicated to enhancing the viewer’s interactions with the museum’s art. Overall, this site’s efforts to inspire creative thinking in its guests can be seen fairly successfully.</p>

            <h3 class="subtitles"><i>Recommendations</i></h3>
        
            <p>Clarity in the lights allow the art pieces to be properly observed, and in turn allow the viewers to perceive all the artists intended to be seen in their artworks. The lighting for these art pieces suits them since they don’t need an intimate ambience created by light, but rather lighting that would highlight the entirety of these specific pieces. There is a large amount of artwork displayed which blurs away the individuality of each piece. There could be a more thoughtful way to separate the pieces from each other perhaps through the physical display it is on or the lighting. The lighting being simple and bright throughout the whole room is a good choice, but I believe that a heavier emphasis on the art pieces would increase a viewer’s focus on the exhibit’s content. I suggest that the art pieces on the walls get an even stronger emphasis so that they stand out more from the walls they are hung on.</p>

            <p>I would also recommend more flair in the signage. The summaries and descriptions of the art pieces are made minimalistic to not distract the viewers from the main displays, but the signage is a very important part of the art that enhances one's experience. The lengthiness of many descriptions on the walls in very tiny, plain font can lose the interest of viewers. Rather than plain texts on the walls near the art, I suggest the bolding of words that the artists want the viewers to absorb the most within the lengthy texts. Doing so would help the key points of the displays be identified, which would further one’s creative thinking on the displays and their exhibits. Better clear usage of the signs would give viewers a larger incentive to fully read through the wall passages and take more time to process the reading. It would also be helpful to place signs either at the front or throughout the museum which more clearly point out which direction leads to which exhibits. As I walked through, I had to look at the tiny art descriptions on the walls to show me which exhibit I was in. Although there can be a few improvements, the museum organizers effectively applied their modes and devices throughout the designed experience overall.</p>
