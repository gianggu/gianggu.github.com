            <p>Understanding what Semantic HTML is, is very important if you want to code professionally. Semantic HTML tags clearly define the role of the content they contain. In contrast, non-semantic HTML tags are ones that don't have a clear indication for what the content they are encompassing mean. Examples of these tags are "div" and "span". Semantic elements are helpful for when other developers take a look at your work to review or revise, when you need to work on your code, and for best SEO practices.</p>

            <div class="post-pics">
                <img src="images/semantic-html.jpeg" width="500" height="auto" alt="semantic html image">
            </div>

            <p>With the article I recently made, I ensured that my code was neatly arranged with specific tags to indicate the distinct purposes for each section. To make sections within sections, I added class tags with clear names to easily keep track of my sections. I made use of the HTML5 elements which make it easier to write cleaner code.</p>

            <p>My goal for the article styling was to match and enhance the vibe of my content. Mine was an analysis of the Shrem Museum’s success on achieving its mission statement through its physical structure, object placement, and interactivity. This topic inspired me to style a clean and balanced look for my article. A big challenge was wrapping my images within their respected paragraphs. We hadn’t yet learned any techniques to complete this when I decided to code this feature so it was a tough situation. I'm a bit of a perfectionist, so I looked for a solution past what we were taught and thus I was able to succeed by using floats. And like fate, the following class taught us how to apply floats in our web designs.</p>
