            <p>When we are taught some skills and then given a task, we may get lost in the desire to quickly produce results. It’s possible that we memorize the formulas and understand how to solve problems when given, but we don’t understand the fundamental concepts of them. This results in the inability to utilize our tools to their full abilities and produce content that is new and complex. This video, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHUtMbJw8iA?si=qBNG8fhKYsFCN2Mi">"Why Is CSS So Weird?",</a> helps us to further understand the concept of CSS and how it is supposed to be used. CSS is meant to be a style sheet language that gives optional rules to the HTML. It has a system that allows its own code to be overruled automatically in appropriate scenarios.</p>

            <div class="post-pics">

            </div>

            <p>In this <a href="https://ishadeed.com/article/css-nesting/?ref=sidebar">CCS Nesting article</a>, we are taught about the purpose of formatting tags a certain way known as nesting with examples. After viewing the examples while reading the article, I understand the benefits of nesting in CSS and how professional front-end developers might frame their code to be most organized and easily understandable. Looking at the demonstrations of the nesting with other HTML elements and tags helps me apply the concept to real work situations.</p>

            <p>Throughout this course, I was able to obtain a strong foundational understanding of HTML and CSS. HTML creates the set up for the website while CSS is its suggested styling. The most important thing is to really know what you are typing, and to be conscious of where you are placing your content. For your personal organization and for when you need to collaborate with other people, having consistency is very crucial. Such as with my Interactive Narrative, mapping out the navigation and content of my website helps simplify the creation process. We must understand our own goal before building in order to work most efficiently and with clarity. Whether it is for prototypes on figma or the actual structure of a website, organization is forever important. </p>
