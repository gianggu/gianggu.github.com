                <p>Getting inspiration rolling for a project is always super exciting. These are the inspirations I liked to think about as I created my Interactive Narrative.</p>

                <p>In my search for inspiration for my Interactive Narrative project, I first stumbled upon this massive catalog of <a href="https://pinchofyum.com/">recipes blog.</a> It uses a lot of gridding so the amount of content viewers is uniquely presented in a non-cluttered manner. Their content is very detailed yet spaced out. I am easily able to tell where I'm meant to look for the next step with the website's layout.  There are two navigation bars, one for the main directory and the second is for internal pages, just like how mine lets you go to the previous or next post. </p>
                
                <div class="post-pics">
                    <img src="images/pinchofyum.jpg" width="500" height="262" alt="pinch of yum">
                </div>

                <p>Though this blog website is very thorough in it's organization, it contains a lot of different fonts. The inconsistency makes the blog lose a bit of its disoriented. The buttons have an interesting gradient transition when hovered over which I may incorporate but at a faster speed since the colors are low in contrast. It's a small detail that is made insigificant because of how slow the gradient is.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <p>This <a href="https://iamafoodblog.com/">blog</a> that has been running since 2010 caught my eye because of its use of bold and symmetrically rounded font families. Its text hierarchy is clearly established with conviction and every one of photos drwas in your attention. The homepage's layout alone shows how trendy this blog is. An interesting feature is the side panel to the right of the page, which shrinks the main content a little bit. I may want to use that feature so my main content and its images aren't too large.</p>

                <div class="post-pics">
                   <img src="images/iamafoodblog.jpg" width="500" height="274" alt="i am a food blog"> 
                </div>
                
                <p>I wish the mouse hover would have an effect but there is no visual cue for when there is something clickable. Its color scheme appeared to be black and white but the internal pages had a navy blue that blurred its stylistic vibe and stuck out uncomfortably. Its content also felt out of order, which would make it tedious for viewers to attempt this blogger's recipes.</p>

            <div>
                <p><a href="https://creativemarket.com/blog/category/design-trends">Creative.market.com</a> is a very useful website for designers looking for inspiration. It contains a wide array of creative content for a handful of specialties. I specifically want to incorporate this <a href="https://creativemarket.com/blog/fall-color-of-the-season-crimson-cherry">Crimson Cherry moodboard</a> and <a href="https://creativemarket.com/blog/summer-color-of-the-season-denim-dreams">Denim Dreams moodboard</a>. </p>
