            <h1>History of Internet</h1>
            <time datetime="yyyy-mm-dd">October 18, 2023</time>
            <p>The internet's advancements have been building off of its foundations from its very beginning in 1969 with its creation of TCP/IPs and packet switching. The makings of faster internet and better connection across multiple networks have been improving very quickly since the year 2000, where newer devices other than computers can operate just as efficiently.</p>

            <p>The introduction of socializing via media was a strange, yet intriguing concept that many people took part in. Being able to communicate without needing to travel and be face-to-face allowed for quicker communication between people. As someone who grew up in the developing era of technology, I also experienced this sort of rush from social media. A tendency for oversharing was especially prevalent in the early years of social media, and it still is an issue today. Difficult situations can come from this such as strangers using your information.</p>
